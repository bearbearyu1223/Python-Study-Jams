here is our forecast
traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip
especially if you have to prepare a presentation
i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings
i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary
too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn
the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format
play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski is
flying somewhere takes too much time
plus your thoughts on any changes that need to be made
follow these steps so you do not misplace these files
i have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good
we have had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders
it will help determine which requests fall under the project scope
use the above to formulate a project plan
ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions
each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid
ability to handle volatility skew and correlations
ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day
approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid
inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets
ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager
currency and volume uom conversions
implicit and explicit position break out issues
hopefully we will know much better where that part stands at that point
the origination side is very sparse
tim mike grigsby is having problems with accessing the west power site
can you please make sure he has an active password
if there are any other questions or information requirements let me know
this property will have the best location for student housing of all new projects just as the duplexes do now
i will know more on this question later today
please mark your calendars
i am still doing my own
i have my copy of the original deal
please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary
it does not make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different
i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers
i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index
it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business
these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit
as such they have to be counted as a development cost even though they are not spent
because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds
the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs
even if the maximum loan would cover all costs it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent
the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side
phasing works as follows
for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport
finally for vendors they are constantly shopped
call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further
nymex expiration is during this time frame
i have scheduled and entered on each of your calendars a meeting for the above referenced topic
call me when you can
the project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan
additionally many of the current and more severe water treatment ordinances have been waived
as with most infill projects the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods is uneven
gated communities are far preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer preferences
you would need to discuss this with an exchange expert first
one of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to start the next day
the severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough to knock it down
there is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize the enormous number of things she does everyday

you have been requested to provide feedback for a participant attending the next program
therefore your feedback is critical
thank you for your participation
i stumbled across some other duplexes for sale on the same street
call or email with your thoughts
i have been preaching the tremendous growth described below for the last year
on the other hand they require so much energy that they could potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures
we cannot start your administration without this information and your raters will have less time to provide feedback for you
but again that might be just what the two utilities receive
he is an analyst in our group
we need each person is email address
it would also be good to have each person is phone number in the event we need to reach them
good luck on the bike ride

i have no doubt that she will compare favorably to others in that category at year end
let me know if there are any issues
then copy this formula to the rows below
subtract amount paid from amount owed
hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider
how is progress on creating the spreadsheets
you will probably need to close the file before you attach to an email
i really want to make some progress on these two files
then email the file back
if we have one year of data we can tell which will be cheaper
use the rates described in the spreadsheet
this is a great chance for you to practice excel
tomorrow gary is going to be here

the course has received very high marks for effectiveness
please take time now to enroll in the program
i did not have time to finish it
i am glad you are enjoying the job

or just type eglobal
your timely response to this request is greatly appreciated
the enclosed version contains deltas and decision variable
you mentioned that you have resources to run the model
please do so
this will help us to gain experience with the market vs the model
the article illustrates the optionality associated with storage operation very well
let me know if you have any questions
frogger had a great run as an arcade classic but it is leaving the shockwave
it must be sent by you
thanks in advance
basically they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some price that undercuts the current provider
the risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage the price risk
this is my best guess
i will get back to you with more
he can call me at work or home
i will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office
having said all of that it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on the generation side
i think the presentation looks good
it would be useful to share this with others up here once you have it finished
if it is the largest marginal consumer then it is obviously a different story
demand charges only
i am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not
please call or email with comments
you can keep a log on paper or on the computer
the computer would be better for sending me updates
this might be more convenient for collecting rent and showing open apartments
we can adjust office hours on another day
owner financing would still work
i hope we can put the past behind us
sounds like you have been busy
congratulations on the new baby
judging from your email all is well with you
three is it for us
my fitness program is not as intense as yours right now
i am just on maintenance
we have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months
he never misses rain or shine
i would like to hear more about your new job
maybe we could grab lunch sometime
i will call the bank again today to resolve authorization on the account

to make a long story short
for what its worth
please continue to send them daily
need to reschedule to the following week
they were polite regarding asset management and procurement function outsourcing and are willing to listen to a proposal
however they are very interested in weather hedges to protect throughput related earnings
as to your other question
that risk may not be acceptable to the desk
you beat my parents by one day
the family is doing fine
grace is really smiling
she is a very happy baby as long as she is being held
it sounds like your house is coming along fast
i think my folks are ready to start building
may is busy
good luck on the house
i will call you in a day or so
thanks for your help
are we going to inspect tomorrow
employees do not have the choice of where to exercise
hopefully this will reach you
talk to you later
this meeting will be brief
i would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done
it is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding
if they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify
jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release
hopefully things will go smoothly
please advise if there are any problems questions or concerns
i need this to finish my tax return
i have all the expense data but not rent collection
a valve adjustment might do some good
glad to hear about the good deposit for this week
read album reviews
the attachment was not attached
whatever the risk was prior should not matter
since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset
the attached prospectus explains the various options for subscribing
if you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me
the rights you set up are fine
thank you for your help
there was no file attached to your message
please try again
go ahead and get a carpet shampooer
make sure it comes back clean after each use
i looked up the rules for withholding and social security
i will call you later today to discuss
saves on gas pollution and helps keep you strong and healthy
enron provides bike racks in the front of the building for requests such as this
if you bring a very good lock you should be able to secure the bike at the designated outside racks
i will get back to them on this
i will check to see if this is enough
i just spoke to the insurance company
please get with randy to resolve
please review and let me know if this is what you had in mind
he was out today
sorry for the slow turnaround
please create an account so we can assist you more effectively in the future
the exterior will be a farmhouse style with porches on front and back
i want a very relaxed and comfortable style but not exactly country
i can not get out
looks like they will need more gas at ehrenberg
maybe mary is stalking gary
first one is free
so are the next thousand
but that is not how shockwave
but you do not care
grab the game from shockwave
it is a chance to crack your old high score
if you have not already get your free machine now
while we do wish to continue telling you about new shockwave
call me with questions
any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart
clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor
if not the state may be in breach of contract
however the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession
also there is no staff defined purpose etc
however this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis
in other words the state will get paid before the utilities
i left feeling very optimistic about the panel system
the prospect of purchasing the panels and having your framers install them may have to be considered
however my first choice would be for you to be the general contractor
please email your cost estimates when complete
i may have overhead slides
i will bring handouts
all the desks are trying to use this program to train analysts to be traders
your experience should help you in the process and make the risk rotation unnecessary
unless you are dying to do another rotation is risk
the topic will the the western natural gas market
i will email you with the insurance info tomorrow
here is a simplistic spreadsheet
i will try and get my dad to take the appraiser into a couple of units
let me know the day and time
i have decided on a floor plan
i will send you that detailed plan and spec list when complete for a final bid
i still use this service
phillip et al
the following are the prices you requested
receipt by an unintended recipient does not constitute a waiver of any applicable privilege
if you have received this communication in error please immediately notify us and delete the original material from your computer
however my closing has been postponed
your bid for the construction is competive with other construction estimates
i am still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local relationships
i could not find any reference to this cash consideration to be paid by the buyers
thanks for the response
i think you are right that engaging an architect is the next logical step
he got back to me yesterday with his first draft
he took my plan and improved it
this is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage
spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis
call me on my cell phone if you need me
i have also attached an extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project
i am not thrilled about such a low return
i am not discounting those services
more cabinets maybe a different shaped island and a way to enlarge the pantry
that might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco
also the front porch would be smaller
i just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work
a pedestal sink would probably work
just dropping you a line to confirm that you have seen it
i was wondering if the prior work even needs to be listed as an asset of the partnership
i would like for the agreements with these consultants to be with the partnership not with me
talk to you this afternoon
he still wants to receive this payment
the townhomes across the street have a serious parking problem
they probably planned for the students to park in the garages but instead they are used as extra rooms
most of these items are in a state of partial completion by the consultants
i have been speaking directly to the architect engineer and soils engineer
i am unclear on what is the best way to proceed with these consultants
the obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above
call me with any questions
i will check his progress this morning and let you know
the kids are on spring break
what will change if we want to try and complete the project in phases
does he need to change what he is going to submit to the city
he was contracted to complete the soils study
he says he will be done with his report by the end of the week
i do not know who needs this report
we spoke on the phone about most of these issues
it is no longer and issue
it is not my desire for you to be left with out of pocket expenses
i agree that you should be refunded any cash investment
my only request is that you help me locate this amount on the closing statement or on some other document
i need to work with the engineer and architect to get things moving
thanks for all your help so far
between your connections and expertise in structuring the loan you saved us from getting into a bad deal
can you help clear this up
on the other hand conveyance of the partnership would be a time and money saver if it was clean
i will write you a letter of recommendation
in the next two weeks we should really have a good idea whether the sale is going through
thanks for the information
it would be helpful if you would send the detailed worksheet that you mentioned
i have always elected to defer any distributions of restricted stock
here is the buyout spreadsheet again with a slight tweak in the format
the property is still in two parcels
he has also completed a topographical survey and a tree survey
hugo is going to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to complete
i thought you might want to contact him directly and ask him some questions
i spoke to him about the possibility of your call and he was fine with that
we left very optimistic about the prospect of working with you on this project
please send it this morning
we have not discussed how to proceed with the land
the easiest treatment would be just to deed it to us
however it might be more advantageous to convey the partnership
can you put me in contact with him
back testing once he gets database created should help him forecast core demand
i do not think we should make him pay late fees if can not communicate clearly
have a good weekend
i will talk to you next week
in about two weeks we should know for sure if these buyers are going to buy the property
i will keep you informed
upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the project we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market
the debt service will be approx
equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage of actual hard construction costs
i would like to proceed and develop the property
making a trip to meet you and take a look at some of your projects seems to be in order
i am trying to get the status of engineering and architectural work to date
let me know if you have an opinion about either
i look forward to working with you
talk to you tomorrow
i am faxing the site plan elevation and floor plans
i just refaxed
please confirm receipt
i faxed you the signed amendment
thank you for your time this evening
your comments were very helpful
thanks for the offer though
work is same as always
specifically that the costs of our project are too high
i have gathered more information that support my concerns
there should adjustments for location and the seasonal nature of student rental property
supply will inevitablely increase to drive this market more in balance
we would not even be able to cover the interim financing
we would like to have a conference call tomorrow to discuss alternatives
let me know when you want to have the other meeting
i do not understand why your people do not contact the desk directly
i need you to figure these out immediately
i will not be in the office next week
also some of the questions were just clarification of what was in a number
let is try and reach an agreement on the construction manager issue tomorrow morning
this of course is subject to the credit officer signing off on the deal
now prices are beginning to fall in response these market responses
you can fax it anytime
what will be different in the fax
there have been some updates to the cost
also the trim material and labor costs have been increased
i still believe that the total cost is more than sufficient but there will be additional updates
rather the total cost for the manager is unit and office is included as a lump sum under amenities
i may add this back in as a rentable unit and delete is as an amenity
tomorrow is fine
talk to you then
i am open all day but just need to get some rest this afternoon
they do not want the school to come back at a later date for something different
i will be checking my messages
the spinning bikes are so much better than the life cycles
i think the equipment would be used much more
members could just jump on a bike and follow the video any time of day
let me know if this is possible
that would we very helpful
hopefully he will not have a bad reaction
there are some small incidental cost that they listed would be paid out of this money
george claims that all of these costs have been in the cost estimates that we have been using
george gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard
here is what you need to bring
i would like to have a copy of the appraisal
i was told that you were faxed the loan application
i will send attachment for a backup
call me if you need some help
the total does not equal the bank deposit
let is get this stuff clean today
i am on msn messenger
justin likes power ranger stuff
kelsey really likes art
books would also be good
thanks for the website
there is a very good chance that they will do this all with one party
we are definitely being considered as that party
this should probably be researched further
i wrote it as if it were from you
it should come from the manager
this needs to be written in on their lease
you guys can make changes if you need to
next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and refrigerators
we have to get this done next week
i will email you a form to use to record serial numbers
the prospective buyers want this information plus we need it for our records
something to look forward to
he wants us to finish the work on the units that are being renovated now
we need to specify those units in the contract
we also need to specify the units that have not been remodeled
i think he will be a good buyer
he is a local with plenty of cash
call me after you get this message
sorry it is so late
the missing money on the spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below
i just want to get the final rentroll to tie exactly to the bank deposit
will have some time today to work on a utility letter
will try again today
what did the seguin doctor think of the place
the investors loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid
then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses
let me know if you can draft these agreements
here is a link to the governor is press release
below are some articles relating to aluminum power and gas prices
thought it would be of interest
there are too many to list individually
that is a long time
the buyer may have sold the property
interest rates may be lower
i am bending over backwards to make the deal work with such an attractive second note
guaranteeing to refinance is pushing too far
can you clarify the dates in the contract
email or call me later today
larry is going to spend time with you to see if he can live without any reports
he was not trying to insult you
the apartments are looking better and better yet the turnover seems to be increasing
remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants
i am not upset that you asked for a raise but the answer is no at this time
we can look at again later in the year
i will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend
but that still was not enough juice
if you received this in error please contact the sender and delete the material from any computer
please let me know if this time fits in your schedules
susan hours are out of hand
we need to find a solution
got your email
i guess we can work out the finer points next week
i have shifted to a slightly different plan
i am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west
the center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts
i am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building
i would like to come and visit you again this month
i can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan
call or email to let me know if this would work for you
you should try their website or call the station to get the full story
it would makes a good case for breathable walls
plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs
another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care
getting cash out is not a priority to me
my job just does not give me the time to manage this property
this property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort
this does not reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price
we will send you a response by this evening
phillip here is the information you requested
now for the stage
checkout this spreadsheet
these numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes
i need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property
i would prefer for you to show it from now on
check my math but it looks like all the builders profit would be recouped in the first year of operation
builder does not benefit from higher cost rather suffers as an equity holder
i realize that what is budget and schedule must be discussed and agreed upon
otherwise try me at home then on my cell
i appreciate your help on this
one for the gas generators is still quite a ways off
do not expect hedgers to come any time soon
i will keep you abreast of developments
not clear this can be resolved
no discussions on this occurred today
hydro as security is dead
republicans were very much opposed to it
we will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon
please submit your response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date
thanks in advance for your cooperation
i have forwarded him your resume
give him a call and he will fill you in on the details of the program
then he switched to biweekly
two weeks rent in advance
he is only paid one week in advance
this is not a big deal but you should be clear with tenants that rent is due in advance
here is an updated rentroll
thanks for your promptness
if we are interested in his loan he would want to come see the site
it sounds like the attorneys are drafting the framework of the partnership agreement
i would like to nail down the outstanding business points as soon as possible
please email or call with an update
the storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas and the forecast was for frigid weather
traders put the two together anticipated a supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights
but critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers
in many circles little else is discussed
church members are suffering from higher bills as well
a year ago that was not a fear
utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by customers
but trouble was brewing
there was a dip in the fall but then prices rebounded
suppliers can lock in sale prices for the gas they expect to produce
like all futures the gas contracts are purchased on credit
but some utility executives did not share that view
now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left customers with such high gas bills
and regulators are being asked whether they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel costs
do not sell my information
call me if there are any issues
i will place a call to my attorney to check on the loan agreement
explain the magnitude of the problem
probably of limited value
these people should update their respective business units
phillip attached are resumes of analysts that are up for rotation
if you are interested you may contact them directly
there are alot of overages
it will probably get worse this month because of all the cold weather
you need to be very clear with all new tenants about the electricity cap
this needs to be handwritten on all new leases
i am going to fax you copies of the bills that support this spreadsheet
i will write something today
wait until you have copies of the bills and the letter before you start collecting
i have left several messages at your office to follow up
you mentioned that your plate was fairly full
please email or call
if that does not work we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor
then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property
please send in different format
i can not open a winmail
his staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea
he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level
as already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities
some of these ideas would require legislative action
this was a frequently recurring theme
take state lands gas royalties in kind
condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state
wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state
securitize uncollected power purchase costs
he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal
he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues
thanks to everyone for their help
we made some progress today
here are my thoughts
i have not made any adjustments to them
here they are plus the excel file is a net worth statement
let is talk later today
i have sent him some information on the project but he needs financial information on you
can you please send it to him
i hope to pull that together this afternoon
he was positive about his experience overall
he did not seem pleased with the bookkeeping or information flow to the investor
i think we should discuss these procedures in advance
let is continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur
i would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed
specifically the transition from interim to permanent financing
i could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks
i am faxing you a project summary
let me know what else you need
i have fed ex would the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out tomorrow
current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future replacement cost
this creates a shortage in later months
california has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand
investigate why it was not maximized operationally
they repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity but injected far less
similar to the power market there is too much benchmarking to short term prices
by design the customers are short at a floating rate
this market has been long historically
it has been a buyers market and the consumer has benefitted
call me if you need any more input
it seems like most people are paying on time
let me know how your forecast differs
the are all trading and need to have unique id is
received the fax
thursday afternoon is the only day that really works for me
let me know if that would work for you
i will try to email you some photos soon
attached please find the spreadsheet containing the above referenced information
i really need to get this by tomorrow
and email it to me tomorrow
you should have all this information on their leases and applications
we have to fully understand the charts and how they are constructed and we ran out of time today
yes you can use this chart
does it make sense
they look good at first glance
i will look at them in depth this weekend
the proforma was in the winmail
please resend in excel or a pdf format
it looks fine
enclosed is the cost breakdown for the appraiser
also we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs are high
i hope to finish the proforma today
let me know if there is anything else you need
can you resend this one in a pdf format
give me a call
no can do
are you in the zone
please excuse the delay in getting these resumes to you
i will try to get a status report to you latter today
put me down as a reviewer
let me know if you disagree
the need is still great for this disk space
he said he would not pay anything
we applied forward gas prices to historical loads
i guess this gives us a picture of a low load year and a normal load year
prices seem low
please provide the names and numbers of several subcontractors used on recent projects
builder assumes some risk for cost overruns
since this project appears so promising it seems like we should tackle these issues now
these questions are not intended to be offensive in any way
she displayed a tremendous amount of commitment to the west desk during that time
she did not crack and provided much needed info during this time
patti is performing the duties of a manager but being paid as a sr
let me know what is an acceptable cash amount
patti was always the first one in the office during this time
this information has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size of the west desk positions
please call to discuss cash award
i am sending you this message to schedule the interview
please call or email me with a time that would be convenient for you
i look forward to speaking with you
the usage dates are much earlier

in the report which is free for a limited time analysts are confident the deal will close soon
simply register and submit a question below
ask the analyst
western spot power prices declined today from a combination of warmer weather across the region and declining natural gas prices
since the weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower
the unit is scheduled to restart this weekend
traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled prices down
yesterday it was bitter cold and today it was just plain cold
adding that other structures will probably remain illiquid until the new year when demand can more easily be assessed
these producers typically generate power to prevent reservoirs from overflowing
consumption currently unseasonably low was expected to rise with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for space heating
traded volume on the power exchange increased in active trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions traders said
we should now see a noticeable increase in the spot price
today is rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used today is news to gain momentum for future increases traders said
as soon as her report is filed we will be sending it to your attention
