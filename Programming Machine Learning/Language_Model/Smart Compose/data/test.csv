here is our forecast
traveling to have a business meeting takes the fun out of the trip
especially if you have to prepare a presentation
i would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings
i would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary
too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn
the meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format
play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski is
flying somewhere takes too much time
plus your thoughts on any changes that need to be made
follow these steps so you do not misplace these files
i have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good
we have had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders
it will help determine which requests fall under the project scope
use the above to formulate a project plan
ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions
each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid
ability to handle volatility skew and correlations
ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day
approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid
inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets
ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager
currency and volume uom conversions
implicit and explicit position break out issues
hopefully we will know much better where that part stands at that point
the origination side is very sparse

i am still doing my own
i have my copy of the original deal
please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary
it does not make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different
i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers
i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index
it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business
these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit
as such they have to be counted as a development cost even though they are not spent
because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds
the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs
even if the maximum loan would cover all costs it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent
the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side
phasing works as follows
for the professional subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport
finally for vendors they are constantly shopped
call when you have reviewed and we can discuss further
nymex expiration is during this time frame
i have scheduled and entered on each of your calendars a meeting for the above referenced topic

the project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan
